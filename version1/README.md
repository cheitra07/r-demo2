# Sales Escalation Analysis in R Shiny

This R Shiny web application allows users to interactively explore sales data, analyze price escalation, and view forecasts for future price trends. The app is designed to visualize sales patterns, perform time series forecasting, and enable users to filter data based on specific time periods (1 month, 3 months, 6 months). Additionally, users can download a dynamic HTML report summarizing the analysis.

## Project Overview

This Shiny app integrates various data processing and visualization techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis of sales escalation:

- **Sales Data Visualization**: It provides interactive visualizations of sales trends using `plotly` and time series forecasting with the `forecast` package.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: The app uses an ARIMA model to forecast future sales based on historical data.
- **VBScript Integration**: Upon app startup, a VBScript (`vbscript.vbs`) is executed to process additional data outside of R, automating tasks that might involve external data processing or file handling.
- **Downloadable Report**: Users can download a report summarizing the sales escalation analysis as an HTML document generated using `rmarkdown`.

## R Shiny Techniques and Key Features

### 1. **Reactive Programming**:
Shiny applications rely heavily on **reactive programming**, which ensures that app elements are updated in response to changes in user inputs. In this application, the `reactive()` function is used to filter sales data dynamically based on the selected time period (1 month, 3 months, 6 months). The filtered data then triggers the update of the sales plot, which is rendered through `plotly`.

### 2. **Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA**:
The `forecast` package is used to perform time series forecasting. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models are applied to the historical sales data to predict future sales values. The `auto.arima()` function selects the best ARIMA model based on the historical data, and forecasts are generated for the next 6 months.

```r
# Example ARIMA model for forecasting
ts_data <- ts(sales_data$Avg_Price, start = c(2023, 1), frequency = 12)
forecast_model <- auto.arima(ts_data)
forecast_data <- forecast(forecast_model, h = 6)
```

### 3. **Interactive Visualizations with Plotly**:
Plotly is used to create interactive plots that allow users to hover over data points, zoom in, and explore trends. The sales trends are plotted as a line graph, and the color of the lines changes based on whether the sales increased or decreased compared to the previous month. This provides an intuitive way for users to visually track sales escalation over time.

```r
# Example of plotly usage for dynamic line graphs
plot <- plot_ly() %>%
  add_trace(
    x = data$date[c(i-1, i)], 
    y = data$sales[c(i-1, i)], 
    type = 'scatter', 
    mode = 'lines+markers', 
    line = list(color = color)
  )
```

### 4. **VBScript for External Data Processing**:
The app includes a feature where a VBScript (`vbscript.vbs`) is executed as the app starts. This script can handle tasks such as manipulating or preparing data externally or performing actions on external files before the Shiny app begins.

```r
# Example of running VBScript from R
system('cscript "D:/path/to/vbscript.vbs"', intern = TRUE)
```

### 5. **Dynamic Report Generation**:
The app also allows users to download a report in HTML format that summarizes the analysis using `rmarkdown`. The report is dynamically generated based on the current state of the data and the selected time period.

```r
# Example of generating downloadable report
output$download_report <- downloadHandler(
  filename = function() {
    paste("sales_report_", Sys.Date(), ".html", sep = "")
  },
  content = function(file) {
    rmarkdown::render("report.Rmd", output_file = file)
  }
)
```

## Folder Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the project folder structure, which organizes the app’s components and assets:

```
/Sales-Escalation-Analysis-R-Shiny/
│
├── /www/
│   ├── d3.min.js               # D3.js for additional visualizations
│   ├── custom.js               # Custom JavaScript for app-specific functionality
│
├── /data/
│   ├── sales_data.csv          # Sample sales data for the analysis
│
├── app.R                       # Main R script containing Shiny app logic
├── report.Rmd                  # RMarkdown template for the dynamic report
├── vbscript.vbs                # External VBScript for additional data processing
├── README.md                   # Project description and setup instructions
```

### Explanation of Folder Structure:

- **/www/**: This folder contains external resources such as JavaScript files (`d3.min.js`, `custom.js`) used for additional customizations and visualizations within the app. D3.js and custom JavaScript might be used for specialized charting or interactive features that complement the Shiny app’s functionality.
  
- **/data/**: This folder includes the sample data file `sales_data.csv`, which contains historical sales data. This data is read and processed by the Shiny app to generate the visualizations and forecasts.

- **app.R**: This is the main R script that contains the Shiny app code. It defines the user interface, server logic, and the reactive components that power the app.

- **report.Rmd**: The RMarkdown template used to generate the downloadable HTML report. This report includes the summary of sales trends and forecasts, and is generated based on user inputs.

- **vbscript.vbs**: This file contains the VBScript that is executed when the app is launched. This external script handles tasks like preparing data or automating operations outside of R.

- **README.md**: The markdown file that provides a brief description of the project, instructions on how to run the app, and technical details of its implementation.

## How to Run the Application

To run the Shiny application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or download the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Install required R packages**:
   Open RStudio and run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("shiny", "forecast", "plotly", "rmarkdown"))
   ```
3. **Run the application**:
   Open `app.R` in RStudio and click the "Run App" button, or execute the following in the R console:
   ```r
   shiny::runApp("path/to/your/app.R")
   ```

4. **Interact with the app**: Select a time period for filtering data, view the sales trends, and download the report.
